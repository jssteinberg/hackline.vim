# hackline.vim

*An opinionated statusline for grownups you can fork and hack. Originally a fork of [skyline.vim](https://github.com/ourigen/skyline.vim).*

* Mode flag/module off by default, or do you need it you noob?
* No themes available or needed---uses usual Vim highlight groups.
	- Note to self: Make it work with vertical splits for old people.
	- Note to self: Some colorschemes have bad contrast on StatusLine highlight group---get some empathy!
* Should work out of the box---so no need for patched font, or are you too shallow?
* A git branch module from skyline.vim, supported by [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
* Word and line count modules from skyline.vim, perfect Vimmers that are writers

Much slimmer alternatives to plugins like [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline), [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline), or [lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim). But, of course, it is not as feature-packed.
